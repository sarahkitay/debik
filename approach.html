          <h1>How I Work</h1>
          <p class="approach-hero-flow__text">
            I offer collaborative, non-pathologizing therapy that helps you see yourself and your life more clearly, in a way that feels grounded, respectful, and real. This is not quick-fix therapy. It's thoughtful work for people who want to understand themselves more clearly and move forward with a greater sense of possibility.

      <section class="approach-flow-section" id="work-feels-like">
        <div class="approach-flow-section__inner">
          <h2>What This Work Feels Like</h2>
          <p class="approach-flow-section__pull">Clients often describe our work as thoughtful and collaborative, grounded rather than rushed, emotionally responsive without being overwhelming, and oriented toward real change, not just insight.</p>
          <p>I don't position myself as the expert on your life. My role is to think with you, ask careful questions, and offer perspectives that support deeper understanding and movement.</p>

          <h2>A Non-Pathologizing Stance</h2>
          <p class="approach-flow-section__lead">Therapy with me isn't about fixing you, because you're not broken.</p>
          <p class="approach-flow-section__pull">I don't begin from the assumption that something is wrong with you.</p>
          <p>Many of the struggles people bring to therapy make sense when viewed in context, of family, culture, gender, relationships, and life stage.</p>
          <p>Rather than asking "What's the diagnosis?" I'm more interested in questions like: How did this pattern develop? What has it helped you survive? What no longer fits?</p>
          <p>This stance allows us to approach change with curiosity rather than judgment, and with respect for the ways you've adapted over time.</p>

        <div class="approach-flow-section__inner">
          <h2>Narrative Therapy</h2>
          <p class="approach-flow-section__pull">Our lives are shaped by the stories we've learned about who we are, what's expected of us, and what's possible.</p>
          <p>In our work together, we pay attention to these stories, where they came from, how they've influenced your choices, and whether they still reflect who you are becoming.</p>
          <p>Problems are not treated as defining features of identity, but as experiences that can be understood, contextualized, and related to differently.</p>
          <p>Together, we work toward new stories that reflect a richer understanding of who you are and who you want to be.</p>
          <p>Many people I work with have developed complicated relationships with food, substances, control, or self-regulation as ways of coping with pain, pressure, or disconnection. Rather than treating these patterns as defining features or failures, we explore what they've made possible, what they've protected, and what they may now be costing you.</p>
          <p>This creates space for change that's grounded in understanding rather than shame or compliance. This process often brings clarity, relief, and a renewed sense of authorship over your own life.</p>

          <h2>Menopause &amp; Midlife</h2>
          <p class="approach-flow-section__pull">I have advanced training in menopause-informed and midlife mental health, and support clients through identity shifts and life transitions that call for depth, context, and care.</p>
          <p>Perimenopause and menopause are often framed narrowly, even though they can shape mood, sense of self, relationships, and life direction in profound ways.</p>
          <p>In therapy, we hold these changes within a broader psychological and relational context, without reducing them to symptoms or dismissing their impact.</p>
          <p>This work often involves grief, re-evaluation, and the emergence of new priorities. My role is to help you make sense of these shifts, with steadiness and self-trust.</p>

        <div class="approach-flow-section__inner">
          <h2>EMDR</h2>
          <p class="approach-flow-section__pull">When appropriate, EMDR allows the nervous system to work with experiences that have not fully settled, without requiring repeated retelling of painful events.</p>
          <p>When patterns around substances, food, or compulsive behaviors are connected to past experiences, EMDR can help loosen what keeps those patterns in place.</p>
          <p>I'm EMDRIA-certified and integrate EMDR into our work in a way that respects pacing, consent, and meaning-making. Used thoughtfully, this work helps loosen what feels automatic or out of control, without reducing your experience to a diagnosis or treatment track.</p>

          <p>If you're looking for highly structured, skills-based therapy or directive advice, my approach may not be the best match.</p>
